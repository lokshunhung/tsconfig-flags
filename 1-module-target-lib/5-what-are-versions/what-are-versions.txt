Language versions
"ES3"    - in 1999, JSON standard based on this version
"ES5"    - in 2009, if need to support IE target this (the 4th version is killed)
"ES2015" - in 2015, sometimes referred as "ES6" (it's the 6th version)
         every year there's a new version, so "ES2016", "ES2017", ...
"ESNext" - the "next" version of ECMAScript (may not be "officially" released)

Language features
- are added into versions through a 5 stage process
- process regulated by the TC39 committee
- features usually push forward by people with a seat in the committee, called "champions"

The TC39 Process (5 stages), see https://tc39.es/process-document/ latest proposals: https://github.com/tc39/proposals
"Stage 0" - allow input into spec
"Stage 1" - additions? shape of solution? potential challenges?
"Stage 2" - syntax? semantics?
"Stage 3" - sorta stable, reviewers signed off spec
"Stage 4" - implementations available, will be added to next language version
